Arcade Jumper game using MSP board with LCD screen, Joystick, and Buzzers

This project was completed as part of the Hardware/Software Interface Course at the University at Albany in 2022 (ECE 233). The Final Report documents notes all improvements I made to the base game as well as showing how these improvements connected to the course concepts. There are 4 code files written in C that were run in parallel on an MSP 432 board which controlled the game.
